# Pedal Power

This proposal uses New York City bikesahring data from Citi Bike during the month of Augusut, 2019. We hope to use this data to show the value of a bikesharing company, such as CitiBike, for the Des Moines, Iowa region. Using Tableau we have created an aesthetically pleasing presentation to show the sixe of the market, understand peak rider times and areas, repair & maintenance costs as well as taking a look at demographics such as gender or age make a difference in the bikeshare market.
